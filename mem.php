					<h3>MemARy</h3></br>
					<p>What if history didn’t only exist in the past? What if it is instead ingrained into the fabric of the city, 
					seeping out if its buildings, its roads and its three dimensional space? As we move around our environment we 
					only see the space around us in its present state. We are often oblivious to the vast quantity of historic events 
					that have occurred right beneath our feet. To the people who lived here and to their memories seemingly lost to a 
					time long since passed. This is particularly the case with a city such as Plymouth, with its long and eventful history.  
					</p>

					<p>MemARy was built around this idea and has two purposes. Firstly as an experiment in ways modern technology can get 
						more people engaged in learning about history. And secondly as a showcase and interactive historical guide of Plymouth 
						and its rich historical heritage, for visitors to the city and as part of Plymouths bid for city of culture 2017.</p>

				<p>The project runs from the Layar browser and makes use of the Poiz framework. It has received sponsored project status from 
					both Layar and Poiz and is currently approved and published on the Layar browser, available in region of Plymouth, England.</p>

				<p>MemARy is a take on the word memory and augmented reality. It is designed to be a sort of interactive treasure hunt. By including 
					an element of gamification in this way, the project hopes to give the user some sense of motivation and reward in searching for 
					and finding the locations. The location of each historical information point are styled as memories. These are memories left behind, 
					not by one individual but of many people over various centuries. They have become interwoven into the location, be it a building or 
					3d space ready to be retrieved and examined though MemARy. Each memory is unique and regarding a number of different historical events 
					from Plymouths past.<p>

					<p>There are two different models used to signify a memory location. The first is an energy field. This is the 
						primary indication that the user has encountered a memory location. The energy field is three dimensional 
						and will appear on screen hovering above a particular location or object. Tapping this energy field will activate 
						the memory location and cause the media attached to that memory, such as video or audio, to play.</p>

						<p><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/portfolio/mem3.jpg" alt=""></p>

					<p>The second 3D model is a large ‘i’. This is to signal that there is an information point. An information point is part of a 
						collection of detailed information regarding the event or location. It will often explain more about the memory than the media 
						contained in the energy field, and if there is image recognition available at that location, will also show what image is recognisable</p>
